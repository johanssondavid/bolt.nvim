The filter is automatically updated as you type , no extra keystrokes needed.

### Searching
![Example Highlight](https://imgur.com/VBUnCBQ.gif)

Quicly perform a search in the active directory using [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). If desired, expand the
results to see which lines that matches your pattern. For convenience, simply start
typing to filter your search results.

### Dual-pane

#### Notice

The development of Bolt.nvim is still in a **very early phase**, so bugs are expected. 
If you find something that needs fixing, please create an issue.

## Installation

**Note:** bolt.nvim requires Neovim(latest is recommended) with Python3 enabled.
See [requirements](#requirements) if you aren't sure whether you have this.

For vim-plug:

```vim

call plug#begin()

Plug 'philip-karlsson/bolt.nvim', { 'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins' }

call plug#end()
```

## Requirements
bolt.nvim requires Neovim with Python3.
tIf `:echo has("python3")` returns `1`, then you have python 3 support; otherwise, see below.

You can enable the Neovim Python3 interface with pip:

    pip3 install neovim

### TODOs:
- Create proper vim documentation
- Complete the dual-pane mode
- Make it possible navigate archives (TC feature)
- Populate README.md with keybindings

this is my first take on writing plugins for Neovim. Additionally, I would like to express my
cincere gratitude to Per-√Öke Blig√•rd and David Johansson for introducing me to the wonderful
world of unorthodox file managers üçª
